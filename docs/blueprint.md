- Personal History & Reporting: Users can view their historical activity logs, track blockchain transaction details, and generate downloadable reports of their footprint.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark theme, reflecting technology and a sophisticated approach to environmental data. Background color: A very dark green-tinted grey (#1A251F) to set a deep, technical, yet organic tone.
- Primary color: A muted, deep forest green (#339966), chosen for its association with sustainability and growth, providing a vibrant contrast against the dark background.
- Accent color: A vibrant deep blue (#2368CC), used to signify technology, trust, and blockchain elements, standing out for interactive components and highlights.
- Headlines font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, tech-forward, and structured appearance, emphasizing data and impact.
- Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its high legibility and clean, neutral aesthetic, ensuring clear presentation of data, logs, and information.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace sans-serif) for displaying blockchain transaction hashes and other technical identifiers clearly.
- Utilize a consistent set of line-art or subtly filled icons, blending environmental motifs (leaves, earth, carbon cycle) with tech-oriented visuals (blockchain links, data graphs, security symbols). Look for icons with a clean, modern aesthetic.
- A dashboard-centric layout for core functionalities, prioritizing data visualization and readability. Employ a multi-column grid for activity logging forms and historical views to enhance organization and user flow.
- Subtle and fluid transitions for data updates on charts and graph interactions. Implement a distinctive, celebratory animation when users successfully commit their carbon footprint data to the blockchain, visually reinforcing the achievement.
